# Age of "Don't do it yourself"

Lately, I started seeing more and more replies to the juniors where they shouldn't try to build something themselves but instead use off the shelf solution.

Couple of examples that come to my mind:
- Don't use servers but rather use provider X/Y/Z
- Don't build your Auth solution
- Don't roll your own dependency but instead install X/Y/Z
- Don't try to write your own operating system

You see the pattern. You will see this in every discussion. People advising for their "best practice" solution leaving out room for any discussion.

I want to see change. It should be more like "Go for it. And come back for advice when you're stuck." There is nothing gained by discouraging learners from... learning.

I'm starting to think that bigger players are scaring people to use anything but their own product. "Production grade quality" or "Production ready" phrases are thrown but the only purpose is to scare you and use their product without thinking much about it.

**Closing thoughts**

This way of thinking leads to zero exploration.

This way of thinking induces fear and making developers less confident.

I hope we encourage each other more in the future and be more instructive instead of discouraging.


PS:
If your reaction is "Well, but it's not responsible to encourage people to roll own security-related stuff." Then please tell them check it out and learn it inside-out. Thank you.
